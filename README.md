# SmartBell_Project
This was the biggest group project that we created at the university.
This Project consits a web page written in React, a backend with C# ASP.NET.
In this project I got the task of the Product Owner/Branchmaster/ Group Leader. My mainly task was to dictate the workflow and check the completed tasks. I held meetings and focused on the success of the project.
I helped out on both sides with the backend and frontend. 
We tried to use an Azure DB connection for the database itself, but after some working days, it just broke down, so we switched back to old local db.
